# Setup Script Evolution Notes

Spectre's setup helper is often a newcomer's first brush with Linux tooling, so we tuned it to narrate what it does and why. After the request to make the script “interactive and informative,” we brainstormed guardrails—checks for Docker availability, Compose plugin presence, udev tooling, USB detection, `.env` backups, and docker-group membership. These additions struck a balance between transparency and practicality: the script now explains each privileged action, pauses for confirmation, and gently points users toward fixes when prerequisites are missing. The goal remains low-stakes curiosity—folks can read along, learn a bit about the environment, and feel comfortable rerunning the helper whenever they plug in new SDR hardware or install Docker on a fresh machine.
