# Noob-Friendly Improv Notes

- Prompt: "Make the project more noob friendly without being condescending" + improv-style latitude.
- Actions taken:
  - Curated hardware + community resources from manufacturer and grassroots sites, pinned them for later UX surfacing.
  - Added README callouts (“Try these experiments” + “Community & learning”) so curious readers always have a next step and see the vibecoding roots.
  - Upgraded the UI with helper tooltips, friendlier error cards (big reassuring message + small technical detail), and a reusable `FriendlyError` component.
  - Logged future onboarding ideas (video clips, glossary, post-setup recap) in the pin list so they stay visible.
- Vibe check: keep things conversational, celebrate tinkering, and leave breadcrumbs for the next curious builder.
