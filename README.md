## About Us

_Spectre_ is a free and open source SDR-agnostic program for recording radio signals and spectrograms. It's geared for hobbyists, citizen scientists, and academics who want to achieve scientifically interesting results at low cost. 

Powered by [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/), it provides high performance on modest hardware. Applications include:  

- Solar and Jovian radio observations
- Educational outreach and citizen science
- Amateur radio experimentation
- Lightning and atmospheric event detection
- RFI monitoring

## **Features**

- Simple installation with Docker
- Wide receiver support (SDRplay, HackRF, RTL-SDR, USRP)
- Run natively on Linux, including Raspberry Pi
- Intuitive CLI tool
- Record spectrograms and I/Q data
- Long-form recordings
- Compatible with [inspectrum](https://github.com/miek/inspectrum)

ℹ️ Looking for a lightweight alternative? Check out [_Spectrel_](https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-lite), a stripped-back derivative of _Spectre_, written in pure C. No Docker required.
