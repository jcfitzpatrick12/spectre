## About Us

_Spectre_ is a free and open source receiver-agnostic program for recording and visualising radio spectrograms. It's geared for hobbyists, citizen scientists, and academics who want to achieve scientifically interesting results at low cost. 

Powered by [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/), it provides high performance on modest hardware. Applications include:  

- Solar and Jovian radio observations
- Educational outreach and citizen science
- Amateur radio experimentation
- Lightning and atmospheric event detection
- RFI monitoring

## **Features**

- Simple installation with Docker
- Wide receiver support (SDRplay, HackRF, RTL-SDR, USRP)
- Run natively on Linux, including Raspberry Pi
- Intuitive CLI tool
- Live record spectrograms and I/Q data  
- Offers fixed and sweeping center frequency modes
- Backend web server with a discoverable RESTful API
- Developer-friendly and extensible

ℹ️ Looking for a lightweight alternative? Check out [_Spectrel_](https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-lite), a stripped-back derivative of _Spectre_, written in pure C (no Docker required).
